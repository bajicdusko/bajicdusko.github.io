### Fintech
I have a great interest in fintech products.  
That's what I was building for the 7 years at least. Some examples are:

- Payment processing solutions (virtual/plastic cards, ACH, Wire).

### Mobile
Android is my first love, it lasts since Froyo, for 10 years, and counting.

### DevOps

- AWS is new big love. Azure is as cool as Amazon. GCP as well.  
- Fan of proper branching strategies, healthy development processes and useful reviews.
- Proponent of software architecture that works.
- Automated QA is a must.

### Free time

When I don't play with the kid, I play with Raspberry. Amateur photographer. Audiophile. Woodworking.
