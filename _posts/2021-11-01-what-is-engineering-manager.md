description: "What does it mean to be an engineering manager and how different it is from being a software engineer?"
---

Software developers as technical persons find desire in making stuff. Engineering the solutions through coding, setup, installations, with its own ingenuity. They gotta love doing that to be really good at it. And it goes on. People spend whole life doing it, with enjoyment.  

Some people don't, though. Although they love what they are doing, they also explore different alternatives of software business. I was doing an android development for 9 years at home, while in parallel I was working .NET stuff 9-5. End then I decided to stop with mobile and focus on DevOps as a hobby, while still doing .NET. And I was pretty good it both.

What usually happens, throughout the years, engineer gets promoted. Medior. Senior. Principal. Depending on the company, all these titles are stacking one after another.  
Software engineers come into position of being a team leaders. They spend a couple of years on that position, keeping the quality high-bar of the team, usually in terms of code, architecture and mentoring.  
Delivery of good results bring benefits and you get in the position of leading the whole project.  
The stakes are bigger. Less time for coding, more time is spent communicating with product managers, customers, guiding team members. And then it happens, you get an offer to be an engineering manager.  
And everyones are super excited, "hey, congratulations on your promotion"! How little they know...  


# What is an engineering manager?

First and foremost. Software engineer, that become an engineering manager, is not promoted. It is a transition from technical role into managerial role. A career choice has been made that is no longer technical. After decade of work, we're in a beginner shoes again, googling this article eventually. Still, let's call it a promotion, but know the difference.

If you are a fresh engineering manager, its completely fine to ask yourself "What should I do?". If you are lucky enough, you'll have someone besides you to show you direction and mentor you. But that's rather an exception.  
14 out of 15 engineering managers are coming from the software development shoes, without any support provided by the company or upper level management. Therefore, don't be too stressed.

Engineering manager have different role in different companies. When I got promoted, I have tried to find a precise definition of my new role and failed. That's because every company has a bit different needs, and we have to adopt to those needs. In some general terms, an engineering manager should taking care of team members and processes.

## Taking care of team members

Engineering manager has a team of up to 10 people. Ideally less than that. Depending on the team toppology in the company, ideally team members are all working on the same project.  

### Trust
Main responsibility of an engineering manager is to build trust with its team members. Its easier said than done. Trust is not assumed, it has to be earned. Promoted engineering managers have much easier job, as they are working the same team for quite some time. However, easiest way to start building the trust with your team member is through honest and open communication. Therefore, having recurring, scheduled and often private 1-1 discussions is a way to go. Optimal 1-1 schedule is every two weeks.
Remember. It takes months and years to build the trust with team members. It also takes a single action to destroy it. Once destroyed, it won't be ever on the previous level, if gained at all.

### Growth
Having team members in a stagnation, not improving themselves is a failure of an engineering manager. Therefore, we should set the goals together with team members and support them in achieving those goals, by providing resources and connections with other experts inside or outside the company.

### Performances
Outputs of an engineering managers are not their personal achievements. Its the output of their team. If the team is not performing well, its a clear sign that something is off. 
Measuring performances in the team is important from many aspects.
- making a fair decision on reward size (bonuses, salary raise etc)
- having a clear insight into growth and achievements of every team member
- having an opportunity to pay attention to underperforming team members to improve their contribution
- affecting the overall team contribution through individual approach to every team member

Performance reviews are done at least twice a year. In some companies every quarter. If you don't have them yet, you should start planning. 

# Taking care of the processes

Depending of the company, engineering manager could be involved into the technical decisions. So I won't spend too much time on it. Some companies are requiring 5+ years of .NET experience for example and active development involvement. Since most of the engineering managers have great software development knowledge, its natural for them to get themselves involved into the technical decisions or at least discussions.  
I like to keep it limited though, as there are other team members in your team that have the accountability of making a technical decision. Usually they don't like to be told what that technical decision might be. So let it be. That's how to show we trust their judgement. Some high-level technical decisons are ok to be part of. Usually from integration point of view with other distributed systems.  
Helping colleagues in better version control, release cycles, deployment strategies is something I like to be involved with. Engineering manager is in a constant communication with product manager as well as with his manager. That provides better perspective over business needs, company goals and that is why one engineering manager could have better insight on how one release process might work.

Apart from technical part of the process, applying software development methodology like Scrum requires additional involvement as well. Being in contact with product manager to plan the next features is out of greatest importance to plan work for your team properly.

# What engineering manager is not?

Usually, engineering managers do not code. My personal opinion is that not many software developers are ready to make a full transition into the management in a single day. That's why I suggest to have the coding option open, for really small things and set the goals for engineering manager, so that they don't fallback to the safe heaven by default. Coding should not slowdown education and advancement of a new position.  

Engineering manager is not a psychiatrist. If you are not an educated one, and chances are you aren't, don't try to be one. We might face a team members in a dificult period of life, when they open up and start talking. The best thing to do is to listen and be there for them, but better provide an advice for them to seek for professional help instead. We could make more harm than good otherwise.
